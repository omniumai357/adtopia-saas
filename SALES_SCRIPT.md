# ðŸš€ AdTopia Sales Script - Revenue Generation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Target Customer: Local Plumber (Joe)**

### **Opening Hook**
"Hey Joe, I noticed your plumbing business could use a modern boost. What if I told you I could get you 20% more calls starting this week with a simple QR code system that costs less than your monthly phone bill?"

### **Problem Identification**
- **Current Issue**: Traditional advertising is expensive and hard to track
- **Pain Point**: Spending money on ads but not knowing if they're working
- **Opportunity**: Missing out on digital customers who prefer quick, mobile interactions

### **Solution Presentation**

#### **Option 1: Quick Start ($49)**
"Joe, for just $49, I'll set you up with a professional QR code system that:
- Gets you a custom QR code for your business
- Works on all your existing materials (business cards, trucks, flyers)
- Tracks every scan so you know exactly how many people are interested
- Delivers results in 24 hours

This is like having a digital business card that never runs out and tells you exactly who's interested in your services."

#### **Option 2: Full Package ($1,997 - 60% Off)**
"Now, if you want the complete system that'll transform your business, I have something special. Normally this costs $4,995, but I'm offering it to you for just $1,997 - that's 60% off.

This includes:
- 5 custom SEO-optimized ad cards
- 12 months of hosting
- Free domain and SSL certificate
- Dual-language support (reach Spanish-speaking customers)
- Premium analytics dashboard
- Phone support from our team
- Everything you need to dominate your local market

This system typically pays for itself in the first month with just 2-3 extra jobs."

### **Social Proof & Urgency**
"I've helped 47 plumbers in your area increase their calls by an average of 35% in the first month. The system works, and I'm only offering this discount to the first 10 businesses this month."

### **Objection Handling**

#### **"I need to think about it"**
"Joe, I understand you want to think it over. But here's the thing - every day you wait is another day your competitors are getting ahead. The $49 option is risk-free. If it doesn't get you at least 2 extra calls in the first week, I'll refund every penny. What do you have to lose?"

#### **"It's too expensive"**
"Joe, let's do the math. The $49 option costs less than your monthly phone bill. If it gets you just one extra job, it's paid for itself. Most of my clients get 3-5 extra jobs in the first month. That's $300-500 in revenue for a $49 investment. Does that sound expensive to you?"

#### **"I don't understand technology"**
"That's exactly why you need this, Joe. You don't need to understand it - I handle everything. You just put the QR code on your materials and watch the calls come in. It's so simple, my 12-year-old nephew could use it."

### **Closing Techniques**

#### **Assumptive Close**
"Joe, I'm going to set you up with the $49 starter package. What's your email address so I can get this started for you today?"

#### **Either/Or Close**
"Joe, which makes more sense for you - the $49 quick start to test the waters, or the full $1,997 system to dominate your market?"

#### **Urgency Close**
"Joe, I only have 3 spots left for this month's special pricing. If you want to secure your spot, I need to know right now. What's your decision?"

### **Follow-Up Script**
"Joe, I'm going to follow up with you in 48 hours to see how the system is working. If you're not getting at least 2 extra calls by then, we'll troubleshoot together. My goal is your success, not just a sale."
