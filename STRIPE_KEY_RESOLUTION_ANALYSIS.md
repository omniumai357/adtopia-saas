Result: Edge Functions cannot access Stripe keys
```

```

### **Issue 2: Edge Functions Missing Stripe Keys**
```yaml
Problem: After redeployment, Edge Functions cannot find STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

Impact: Revenue pipeline completely non-functional
```

### **Issue 3: Configuration Mismatch**

```

```

### **Step 2: Verify Key Configuration**
```yaml
Action: Ensure Edge Functions Secrets contain valid Stripe keys
Check: Keys are active and have proper permissions

```

### **Step 3: Redeploy Functions**
```yaml
Action: Redeploy Edge Functions to pick up new keys
Command: supabase functions deploy --project-ref auyjsmtnfnnapjdrzhea

```

### **Step 4: Test Revenue Pipeline**
