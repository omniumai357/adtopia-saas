## Current Focus: Revenue Generation
All efforts should be directed toward:
1. Getting payment links working
2. Testing end-to-end payment flow
3. Launching customer acquisition campaigns
4. Optimizing conversion rates

## North Star Test
Before adding any feature, ask:
1. Does this reduce friction for a paying customer or partner?
2. Does this create, protect, or measure revenue?
3. Can it be deployed with <3 commands?

If not, add it here instead of implementing now.
