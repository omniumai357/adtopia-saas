## ðŸ“ž **Cold Call Script**

### **Opening Hook (15 seconds)**
```
"Hey Joe, this is [Your Name] from AdTopia. I noticed your plumbing business could use a modern boost. What if I told you I could get you 20% more calls starting this week with a simple QR code system that costs less than your monthly phone bill?"
```

### **Problem Identification (30 seconds)**
```
"Most plumbers I talk to are spending money on Google Ads but can't track if they're actually working. They're missing out on customers who prefer quick, mobile interactions. Sound familiar?"
```

### **Solution Presentation (45 seconds)**
```
"For just $49, I'll set you up with a professional QR code system that:
- Gets you a custom QR code for your business
- Works on all your existing materials - business cards, trucks, flyers
- Tracks every scan so you know exactly how many people are interested
- Delivers results in 24 hours

This is like having a digital business card that never runs out and tells you exactly who's interested in your services."
```

### **Social Proof (30 seconds)**
```
"I've helped 47 plumbers in your area increase their calls by an average of 35% in the first month. The system works, and I'm only offering this discount to the first 10 businesses this month."
```

### **Live Preview Hook (30 seconds)**
```
"Here's what I want to do - I'll send you a live preview link where you can see exactly how this works. You can test it yourself, see the QR code in action, and decide if it makes sense for your business. Sound fair?"
```

### **Close (15 seconds)**

### **Email 2: Follow-Up (48 hours later)**
```
Subject: How's the preview working? (Joe's Plumbing)

Hey Joe,

I wanted to follow up on the preview link I sent you yesterday.

Have you had a chance to test it out? I'm curious what you think about the QR code system.

Most of my clients get 3-5 extra jobs in the first month with this system. That's $300-500 in revenue for a $49 investment.

If you're ready to get started, just reply with "YES" and I'll have your system live within 24 hours.

If you have questions or concerns, I'm here to help. Just call me at [phone number].

Best,
[Your Name]
AdTopia.io
```

### **Email 3: Final Push (7 days later)**
```
Subject: Last chance for 60% off (Joe's Plumbing)

Hey Joe,

I wanted to give you one final heads up about the QR code system.

The 60% off beta pricing expires in 48 hours, and I only have 3 spots left for this month.

After that, the price goes back to $297 for the full package.

If you want to secure your spot at the beta price, just reply with "YES" and I'll get you set up immediately.

This is the last email I'll send about this, so if you're interested, now's the time.

Call me if you have any questions: [phone number]

Best,
[Your Name]
AdTopia.io
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objection Handling**

### **"I need to think about it"**
```
"I understand you want to think it over. But here's the thing - every day you wait is another day your competitors are getting ahead. The $49 option is risk-free. If it doesn't get you at least 2 extra calls in the first week, I'll refund every penny. What do you have to lose?"
```

### **"It's too expensive"**
```
"Joe, let's do the math. The $49 option costs less than your monthly phone bill. If it gets you just one extra job, it's paid for itself. Most of my clients get 3-5 extra jobs in the first month. That's $300-500 in revenue for a $49 investment. Does that sound expensive to you?"
```

### **"I don't understand technology"**
```
"That's exactly why you need this, Joe. You don't need to understand it - I handle everything. You just put the QR code on your materials and watch the calls come in. It's so simple, my 12-year-old nephew could use it."
```

### **"I already have a website"**
```
"Great! This works with your existing website. The QR code just makes it easier for people to find you. Instead of typing in your web address, they just scan the code and instantly get to your site. It's like having a shortcut to your business."
```

### **"I'm not sure it will work for my business"**
```
"That's why I'm offering the preview first. You can test it yourself, see how it works, and decide if it makes sense. If it doesn't work for your business, you haven't lost anything. But if it does work, you've just found a new way to get customers."
```
